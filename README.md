# JAC444 - Java Workshops
Java is a widely-used, class-based, object-oriented programming environment. Its appeal comes from platform independence, programming convenience, and a rich and vibrant ecosystem.

Topics studied will include object-oriented concepts, lambda expressions, functional interfaces, threads, exceptions, graphical user interface programming with Java FX, input / output, networking, client-server programming, servlets, and database access via JDBC
