# JAC444 - Java Workshops
Java is a widely-used, class-based, object-oriented programming environment. Its appeal comes from platform independence, programming convenience, and a rich and vibrant ecosystem. This subject will serve as a thorough introduction to Java as an object-oriented and functional programming language. Topics studied will include object-oriented concepts, lambda expressions, functional interfaces, threads, exceptions, graphical user interface programming with Java FX, input / output, networking, client-server programming, servlets, and database access via JDBC

- [x] Workshop 1
   -  Basic concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction.
   -  First, develop a Stack class. Second, develop a second Java class named Palindrome that in its main method, receives a string as a command-line argument, and then uses a Stack object to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.
- [x] Workshop 2 - Task 1
- [x] Workshop 3 - Task 2 and 3
   -  Basic concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and exceptions.
   -  Task 1: develop Circle, Square, Rectangle, Parallelogram, and Triangle Class and calculate perimeters of all shpaes
   -  Task 2: get min perimeter of triangle and max perimeter of circle and delete them from the shpaes
   -  Task 3: calculate and print the total perimeter of all parallelograms and the total of all trianlges
- [x] Workshop 4
   -  Object Serialization using console
- [x] ~~Workshop 5~~
   -  ~~Object Serialization using GUI - Swing~~
- [x] Workshop 6
