A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. 
Stack is a simple data structure/container which acts as LIFO (last element in, would be the first element out.)

first, develop a Stack class. Second, develop a second Java class named Palindrome that in its main method, 
receives a string as a command-line argument, and then uses a Stack object to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.
